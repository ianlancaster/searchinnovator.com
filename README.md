This is the repository for my personal website. I have worked to combine my Front-End development and Wordpress knowledge to create a site that run on a Wordpress backend and a React Redux Front-End. All communication is done through the new Wordpress API making for a hyper-fast website that is killer for SEO. The Front-End is based off of @davezuko 's amazing react-redux-starter-kit with a few modifications to make the directory and application structure nice and modular.

My to do list:

* Change infinite scroll to use event emitter rather than redux
* Switch over to a Jest testing stack
* Implement resolve root for sass imports


A little later:
* Implement WebPack code splitting to in corporate react native
  * iOS
  * Android
* Implement code splitting for electron deployment
